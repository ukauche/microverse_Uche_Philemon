          Don’t make the mistake of underestimating how important technical
          documentation is to your company’s overall success. It is an essential
          part of communication and means that members of your team don’t
          literally have to be available every time someone has a question,
          whether that be a customer or a stakeholder from your team. You don’t
          have to approach technical documentation with a heavy heart – if you
          follow the steps we’ve outlined in this guide then you’ll be well on
          your way to creating content that is helpful for your users. They’ll
          be empowered to use your product and have more fun using it, which is
          exactly the goal of technical documentation.
